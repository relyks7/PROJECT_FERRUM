**PROJECT_FERRUM**

Metal-optimised kernels with fused ops for extremely fast and efficient single-device training.

Makes sparse attention possible in sub-quadratic time.

Can be turned into a wrapper to create fused kernel ops for any function, drastically increasing speed.

Expansion to CUDA could follow.
